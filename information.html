                    <h2>What is Prevent?</h2>
                    <p>Prevent is a government strategy aimed at saving those who may be vulnerable to extremist ideologies, or supporting extremist groups. It also aims to rehabiliate
                        individuals already in or previously involved with said groups. It is part of the British Government's CONTEST framework for tackling the risk posed by terrorist organisations to the UK and it's people.</p>
                    <p>In short, Prevent aims to:</p>
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item">identifying people who may be at risk of recruitment into terrorist groups and ideologies.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">provides assistance to prevent vulnerable persons from extremist groups and ideologies.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">provide training and understanding of extremism with partners such as local authorities, emergency services, educational institutions, community groups and parents.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">respond to the ideological challenge of extremism, and the threat posed by those advocating for it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The programme works with professionals such as teachers, healthcare workers, charities, religious leaders, social care, psychologists and the police, however is by no means restricted to these. It is delivered by local authority teams, policing teams,
                        community organisations and other groups with the best expertise. It does not target any one age group, nor does it target any one community - it deals with all forms of extremism including Islamist, extreme right-wing, and others such as incel.</p>

                    <h2>Recognising Risks</h2>
                    <p>Recognising the signs of radicalisation can help prevent individuals from being drawn into terrorism. Signs may include changes in behavior, expressing extremist views, and isolating themselves from family and friends.</p>

                    <h2>What is Channel?</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>The Channel programme provides support for those at risk of radicalisation, supporting extremist/terrorist organisations or commiting acts of terrorism - regardless of age, faith, background or ethnicity.
                        People can recieve support before they begin a trajectory towards terrorist activity, or once they are on it. Local authorities will have a Channel panel in their area, who will develop a support plan for
                        people adopted as cases.</p>
                    <p>This programme is entirely voluntary - those who are referred to the Prevent program must give their consent before they may be given support. Those who choose not to engage with Channel, or who decide to stop continuing with the process may be given
                        alternate forms of support, either from the local authority or similar providers - with any risks managed by the police.</p>
