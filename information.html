                    <p>Prevent is a government strategy aimed at saving those who may be vulnerable to extremist ideologies, or supporting extremist groups. It also aims to rehabiliate
                        individuals already in or previously involved with said groups. It is part of the British Government's CONTEST framework for tackling the risk posed by terrorist organisations to the UK and it's people.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In short, Prevent aims to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>provides assistance to prevent vulnerable persons from extremist groups and ideologies.</li>
                        <li>provide training and understanding of extremism with partners such as local authorities, emergency services, educational institutions, community groups and parents.</li>
                        <li>respond to the ideological challenge of extremism, and the threat posed by those advocating for it.</li>
                    </ul>
