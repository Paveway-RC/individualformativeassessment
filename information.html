                    <h2>What is Prevent?</h2>
                    <p>Prevent is a government strategy aimed at saving those who may be vulnerable to extremist ideologies, or supporting extremist groups. It also aims to rehabiliate
                        individuals already in or previously involved with said groups. It is part of the British Government's CONTEST framework for tackling the risk posed by terrorist organisations to the UK and it's people.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are four pillars to Prevent, known as the 4 P's:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prevent:</strong> the main aim - stopping vulnerable people from becoming terrorists, or supporting extremist ideologies that condone it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pursue:</strong> stopping terrorist attacks before they happen.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect:</strong> strengthen community protection against terrorist attacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare:</strong> mitigate the impact of an attack.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Recognising Risks</h2>
                    <p>Recognising the signs of radicalisation can help prevent individuals from being drawn into terrorism. Signs may include changes in behavior, expressing extremist views, and isolating themselves from family and friends.</p>

                    <h2>Reporting Concerns</h2>
                    <p>If you have concerns about someone being radicalised, it is important to report it to the appropriate authorities. This can help ensure that the individual receives the support they need and prevent potential threats.</p>
